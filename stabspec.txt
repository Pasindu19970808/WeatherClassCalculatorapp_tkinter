File name : stnyyyy
            where stn = station code
                 yyyy = year
                   (e.g. cch1999 means data for Cheung Chau for 1999)

Record Layout : Hourly record in sequence starting from 0100 hour
                on the 1st day of the month

       Field 1 : YYMM (year and month)
       Field 2 : DDHH (day and hour)
       Field 3 : 10-minute mean wind direction in degree
       Field 4 : 10-minute mean wind speed in tenths of m/s
       Field 5 : Pasquill Stability Class x 10
       Field 6 : Temperature in tenths of degree Celsius (Optional)

  e.g. Field    1    2    3    4    5    6
             9901  101  130   50   12  203

       9901 - YYMM : Year = 1999; Month = January

        101 - DDHH : Day  = 1st;  Hour  = 0100

        130 - 10-minute mean wind direction in degree = 130
              (9999 means variable)

         50 - 10-minute mean wind speed in tenths of m/s = 5.0

         15 - Pasquill Stability Class x 10 = 1.5

        203 - Temperature in tenths of degree Celsius = 20.3
